# Resume-Building-Website
My first website using Bootstrap CSS Framework.

## Deployment
Deployed the website using GitHub pages. [Go to site] (https://harshh18.github.io/Resume-Building-Website/)

## Built with
* HTML 5 
* Bootstrap 4

## Some info
* The images file are encoded in Base64 format. Base64 is a way to encode binary data into ASCII text, which makes it possible to include the data directly in HTML or CSS code, without requiring a separate file. 
* When the HTML code containing this image source is rendered in a web browser, the browser will decode the Base64 data and display the image.
* In this way, we donot need to store the images/assets in any storage but this practice is not recommended because it will make the code more complex.
* If got some time decode the image source into actual image file and send PR.
